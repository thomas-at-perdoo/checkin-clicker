# Check-in clicker

You are the ambassador of a small company. Your colleagues rarely check-in in Perdoo.
Your job is to reach 1 check-in per user per week.

When an employee is ready to check-in they get an arrow on their head

If you click on them you'll complete the check-in for that employee.

The more check-ins you complete, the more features you'll have access to. Each features helps you moving closer to your goal.
